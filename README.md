# High Energy Physics and AI Engineering Research

I am a third-year Artificial Intelligence student at the Universidade de Vigo (UVigo). This repository is a dedicated research space for exploring the intersection of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Machine Learning, and High Energy Physics (HEP).

The primary objective of these laboratories is to implement and evaluate efficient large-scale data processing workflows using the Scikit-HEP ecosystem. My research focuses on analyzing datasets from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, with a specific emphasis on algorithmic optimization and computational performance.

## Technical Focus

* **Data Processing:** Implementation of columnar analysis via UpROOT and Awkward Array to optimize memory access patterns and execution speed.
* **Computational Efficiency:** Development of low-latency event processing logic and optimization of data structures for scientific computing environments.
* **Physical Modeling:** Application of relativistic kinematics for particle decay identification and invariant mass reconstruction.

## Repository Structure

* **01_Physics_Study:** Implementation and mathematical modeling of core concepts derived from specialized physics literature, with a primary focus on Special Relativity and Electromagnetism.
* **02_Algorithms:** Analysis and implementation of algorithmic designs based on foundational literature, focusing on time complexity, memory management, and hardware-level optimization for scientific computing.
* **03_HSF_Training:** Technical implementations and analysis scripts following the standards of the HEP Software Foundation (HSF).
