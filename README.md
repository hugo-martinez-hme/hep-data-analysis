I am an Artificial Intelligence student at the **Universidade de Vigo (UVigo)**. This repository serves as a specialized research laboratory focusing on the intersection of **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**, **Deterministic AI**, and **Particle Physics**. This work is specifically designed as a technical portfolio for **GSoC 2026**.

## 📚 Project Structure

### [01] Foundations: Scikit-HEP & High-Performance Analysis
Following the **HEP Software Foundation (HSF)** standards, this module establishes the groundwork for professional-grade scientific software development and data processing.
* **Vectorized Data Analysis:** Transitioning from imperative loops to high-performance **Array-Oriented Programming**. Focused on Higgs boson reconstruction using NumPy, `vector` library, and handling **Jagged Arrays** via Awkward Arrays.
* **Machine Learning Suite:** Implementation of supervised learning workflows for signal/background separation. Comparing **Scikit-learn (Random Forests)** and **PyTorch (Neural Networks)** using both ATLAS simulated and experimental data.
* **Software Sustainability:** Application of clean code principles, containerization (Docker/AlmaLinux 9), and specialized tools like `uproot` for **ROOT** file diagnostics and structural inspection.

### [02] ATLAS TileCal: Signal Reconstruction & Pulse Analysis
The **Tile Calorimeter (TileCal)** is crucial for measuring hadron energy at ATLAS. This module explores Deep Learning as an alternative to traditional **Optimal Filtering (OF)**.
* **The Challenge:** In the HL-LHC, the high collision rate causes **Out-of-time pile-up**, where pulses from different events overlap within the same 150ns window.
* **Research Pipeline:**
    1. **Data Generation:** Simulating realistic TileCal pulses with Gaussian noise and multi-pulse pile-up.
    2. **Benchmark:** Proving the failure of standard MLP architectures under high-noise conditions.
    3. **Innovation:** Implementation of a **Temporal Recurrent Network (LSTM)** in PyTorch that treats the 7 ADC samples as a sequence, significantly improving energy resolution.

### [03] CMS Archi: Decoupled Agentic Workflows with MCP
Applying modern systems engineering to physics operations by implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.
* **Objective:** Building a reliable AI "Research Assistant" for the CMS experiment.
* **Architecture:** Using a decoupled approach where the LLM (Reasoning) is separated from the Physics Tools (Execution).
* **Deterministic Tools:** Custom MCP servers providing real-time data access, invariant mass calculations, and system monitoring within an AlmaLinux 9 environment.
